## What is OpenVote?

OpenVote is an offline, cryptographically verifiable public voting system using LoRa mesh radios, hardware authentication keys, and open-source software


## Why OpenVote Exists

OpenVote exists because:

• People no longer trust centralized institutions

• They no longer believe in neutral referees

• They no longer accept opaque systems

And they no longer feel meaningfully represented by industrial-scale politics.


OpenVote does not attempt to “fix” national elections.

It offers something different:

A way for local communities to reclaim decision-making using infrastructure they can see, touch, audit, and operate themselves.


It enables:

• Neighborhood councils

• Cooperatives

• Associations

• Community energy projects

• Local referenda

• Autonomous grassroots organizations



## Why Offline Public Voting 

The ability to decide and to vote is fundamental to any functioning society.

Yet across the world, growing numbers of people feel alienated from political systems that appear distant, unresponsive, opaque, and unchangeable. Voting often happens infrequently, through processes few truly understand, and too often delivers outcomes that feel like “more of the same”—regardless of which option wins.

Technology has not solved this crisis of trust. In many countries, digital voting systems depend on centralized databases, proprietary software, uninterrupted power, and permanent internet connectivity. 

High-profile elections—including in the United States—have been affected by equipment failures, contested results, lost ballots, power outages, software errors, and allegations of manipulation. These systems ask citizens to trust institutions, vendors, and invisible backend infrastructure they can neither see nor verify.

OpenVote takes a completely different approach.

Rather than attempting to digitize existing centralized models of democracy, OpenVote uses open-source hardware, open-source software, and public cryptography to build permissionless, local, and verifiable democratic infrastructure from the ground up.

OpenVote is not a platform.

It is not a company.

It is not a centralized service.

It is a community-owned voting system that runs entirely offline, powered by low-cost hardware and long-range LoRa mesh networks. It allows people to organize, vote, and verify results across villages, neighborhoods, rural regions, and disconnected areas—without the internet, without mobile networks, without cloud servers, and without gatekeepers.


### From Institutional Trust to Mechanical Legitimacy

Traditional elections are built on the idea of neutral arbitration:

• A central authority manages the process

• A trusted organization counts the votes

• Citizens are asked to believe the system is fair


OpenVote rejects this model.

There is no neutral arbitrator in OpenVote.

Fairness is not a promise.

Fairness is coded into the system itself.

Democratic legitimacy in OpenVote emerges from:

• Cryptographic identity stored in personal hardware keys

• Independent, redundant Town Hall systems operated by opposing sides

• Public, append-only audit logs visible in real time

• End-to-end Proof-of-Vote confirmations returned directly to voters

• Open firmware and open software that anyone can inspect

• Public participation in unboxing, firmware flashing, and first-boot trust ceremonies


With OpenVote trust is not placed in institutions. It is derived from physical visibility, cryptography, and mutual adversarial oversight.


### No Neutral Arbitration

In OpenVote:

• The Yes side runs its own Town Hall hardware

• The No side runs its own Town Hall hardware

• Both receive the same radio messages

• Both maintain their own logs

• Both compute their own tallies

At the end of the election, results must mathematically match.

There is no referee.

There is no privileged counter.

There is no hidden database.

Fraud would require corrupting both opposing systems at once—a task that is structurally, politically, and publicly visible.

This is not neutrality by authority. It is fairness enforced by architecture.



### Public Participation as the Root of Trust

OpenVote treats public participation in the technical process itself as the foundation of legitimacy.

Before any election:

• Devices are unboxed in public

• Firmware is flashed in public

• First boot happens in front of observers

• Device fingerprints and firmware hashes are recorded publicly

• A public hardware registry is created

• A Root Registrar Key controls which identities may vote


This process known as Digital Democracy Day (D3) ensures that trust does not begin in factories, sealed boxes, or unseen servers. It begins in the open, with the community physically watching the system come to life.


### Transparent Voting Without Central Control

When a citizen votes with OpenVote:

• Their identity is verified using a personal cryptographic hardware key

• Their vote is transmitted over a LoRa mesh network

• The vote is validated independently by multiple Town Hall systems

• A Proof-of-Vote receipt is returned to the voter

• The vote immediately appears in a public live log

Anyone can verify that their vote exists


There is:

❌ No secret counting

❌ No hidden backend

❌ No invisible recount

❌ No dependency on distant infrastructure


Results are not trusted because someone says they are correct. They are trusted because anyone can see them accumulate in real time.

## Core Principle

OpenVote does not ask for trust - it makes trust unnecessary.

By encoding democratic legitimacy directly into hardware, radio networks, and public cryptographic process, OpenVote transforms voting from a matter of belief into a matter of verifiable physical reality.
