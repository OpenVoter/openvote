**# OpenVote v0.3**

Public Legitimacy & Adversarial Architecture Update

Status: First complete end-to-end technical iteration

Purpose: To define OpenVote as a unified system combining hardware, firmware, cryptography, radio networking, public verification, and adversarial security into a single coherent democratic machine.

This document replaces earlier fragmented technical and security drafts with a holistic architecture designed for implementation, manufacturing, and security review.




**1. System Purpose & Design Principles**

1.1 Purpose

OpenVote is an offline, permissionless, cryptographically authenticated voting system using low-power LoRa mesh networks and public hardware verification to deliver local democratic legitimacy without centralized control.

1.2 Core Principles

Offline-first (no internet, no SIM, no cloud)

Hardware-rooted identity (cryptographic keys in physical devices)

Public trust ceremonies (unboxing, flashing, first boot)

No neutral arbitration

Adversarial verification (Y-side vs N-side Town Halls)

Public, append-only auditability

Proof-of-Vote returned to every voter

Open-source firmware, app, and protocols





**2. High-Level System Architecture**

2.1 Core Components

Voter Node

Android phone (no SIM required)

Wio Tracker L1 (LoRa + GPS)

SoloKey (USB-C authentication key)

USB-C OTG cable


Town Hall Node (×2 for redundancy)

Large-screen Android device

Wio Tracker L1 (relay/receiver mode)

SoloKey (election control key)

Public display screen


Radio Network

Meshtastic LoRa mesh

EU 868 MHz only (this version)






**3. Identity & Authentication Model**

3.1 Dual-Layer Authentication

A. Trusted Hardware Layer

Each Tracker has a unique Node ID

Only registered Trackers may transmit votes



B. Personal Credential Layer

Each voter holds a SoloKey

SoloKey stores private key

Public key registered to voter ID

Family/shared-device use case supported:

Many SoloKeys → One Tracker





3.2 Root Registrar Key

A designated SoloKey controls:

Voter credential registration

Tracker whitelist

Election activation credentials






4. Public Trust & Supply Chain Security (D3)

4.1 Digital Democracy Day (D3)

Public ceremony including:

Device unboxing

Firmware flashing

First boot

Hash verification (SHA-256)

Device fingerprint capture

Entry into Public Hardware Registry


4.2 Public Hardware Registry

GitHub repository (public)

Password-protected USB mirror (offline backup)

Includes:

Tracker Node IDs

Firmware hashes

Activation timestamps






**5. Vote Message Protocol**

5.1 Compact Payload Format (≤ 64 bytes)

Binary-packed fields:

Election ID (compressed)

Voting round

Tracker Node ID

Credential ID (public key hash)

Vote choice (Y/N)

Timestamp (compressed)

GPS flag + coarse location

ECDSA signature (truncated)


5.2 Mesh Behavior

Multi-hop LoRa routing

Redundant packet broadcast

Town Hall P2P ACK + Proof-of-Vote return





**6. Proof-of-Vote System**

Each valid vote triggers a P2P return message to the voter containing:

Election ID

Vote hash

Town Hall Node ID

Timestamp

✅ symbol for visual confirmation


Voter can:

Screenshot confirmation

Independently verify appearance in the public Town Hall log





**7. Transparent Logging & Public Display**

Town Hall displays:

Live vote stream

Running tally

Public hash chain


Logs are:

Append-only

Time-ordered

Exportable via USB






**8. No Neutral Arbitration Model**

8.1 Dual Town Hall Architecture

Y Team Town Hall

N Team Town Hall


Both:

Receive identical radio traffic

Independently validate

Independently tally

Independently publish final vote hashes


Results must match mathematically. No central referee exists.




**9. GPS Locality Enforcement**

Only Trackers with:

GPS fix

Approved geographic region can submit votes.



Used to:

Prevent remote replay

Enforce local residency

Enable geofenced elections





10. Android Application (OpenVote App)

10.1 Voter App Features

SoloKey validation

Election selection

Vote casting

Proof-of-Vote receipt display

Public log lookup


10.2 Town Hall App Features

Vote ingestion

Signature validation

Live display

USB export

Hash comparison mode


10.3 Distribution Model

USB-only distribution

Public SHA-256 verification

No app stores

No internet dependency





11. Adversarial Threat Model Summary

OpenVote assumes:

Malicious insiders

Compromised hardware

Jammed radios

Fake apps

Supply chain tampering


Security strategy:

Public trust ceremonies

Dual adversarial Town Halls

Hardware-rooted cryptography

Proof-of-Vote

Open source app and firmware 

Don't trust, verify.





12. Operational Modes

Single-question referenda

Multi-round votes

Emergency votes

Family/shared-device voting

Geofenced community decisions





13. Manufacturing & Developer Integration Targets

13.1 Hardware Partners

Seeed Studio (Wio Tracker L1)

SoloKeys (USB-C security keys)


13.2 Software Stack

Meshtastic firmware fork

OpenVote Android app

Town Hall display software

Public registry tooling





14. What v0.3 Achieves

Openvote v0.3 delivers for the first time:

✅ Unified hardware + crypto + radio + legitimacy
✅ Offline adversarial voting
✅ Public supply chain trust
✅ Proof-of-Vote
✅ No neutral arbitration
✅ Family & shared-device voting
✅ Transparent real-time verification





15. Scope of v0.3

Target voters: 5–100

Geography: EU 868 MHz

Pilot-scale, community governance

Not for national elections

No internet dependency





16. Future updates (work in progress)

Hardware enclave signing

Vote compression improvements

Multi-community mesh interlinks

Solar Town Hall nodes

Disaster-resilient voting modes





✅ Summary Statement

OpenVote v0.3 is the first complete technical realization of a voting system that removes institutional trust and replaces it with public cryptographic legitimacy, adversarial verification, and physically observable process.
